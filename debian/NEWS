vim-command-t (4.0-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  The package now uses Vim's native package manager, added in Vim 8. As a
  result, vim-addon-manager is no longer used and the package is always
  enabled for all users.

vim-command-t (2.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The command-t addon is now installed system-wide, by default. This works
  arounds problems caused when upgrading the addon: unless every user
  remembers to re-install the addon after the upgrade, then invoking :CommandT
  will break Vim in a variety of interesting ways.
