vim-command-t (4.0-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  The addon is no longer installed system-wide by default. As a result, if the
  addon was previously installed system-wide, then it will have been removed
  when upgrading to this version of the package.

  This is because vim-addon-manager has been improved to fix the problem
  described in the previous NEWS.Debian entry. As a result, we will no longer
  have to for the addon to be installed system-wide.

  To get the addon enabled again, run 'vim-addon-manager install command-t' as
  before.

vim-command-t (2.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The command-t addon is now installed system-wide, by default. This works
  arounds problems caused when upgrading the addon: unless every user
  remembers to re-install the addon after the upgrade, then invoking :CommandT
  will break Vim in a variety of interesting ways.
