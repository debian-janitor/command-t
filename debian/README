command-t plug-in for Debian
============================

This package provides the command-t vim addon, but it is not enabled by
default. If you want to enable it for your account, execute
'vim-addons install command-t'. If you want to enable it for all users
of the system, execute 'vim-addons -w install command-t'.

vim-addons is provided by the vim-addon-manager package; have a loot at
its man-page for more information.
