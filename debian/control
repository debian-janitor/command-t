Description: open files with a minimum number of keystrokes
 Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and
 are ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in
 certain locations (for example, immediately after a path separator)
 should be given more weight.
 .
 Command-T is named so because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window
 bound to Command-T in TextMate.
